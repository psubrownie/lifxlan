# lifxlan

**lifxlan** is a Python 2 and Python 3 module for locally controlling LIFX devices (such as lightbulbs) over a LAN. It implements the [LIFX LAN Protocol V2](https://github.com/LIFX/lifx-protocol-docs) specification. Supports white, color, multizone (LIFX Z strips), and infrared (LIFX+) capabilities.

## How to Install

To get the latest stable release:

`sudo pip install lifxlan`

However, to be guaranteed to get the most recent features and fixes you can install from source with:

`sudo python setup.py install`

## Run

See the `examples` folder for example scripts that use **lifxlan**.  

Many of the examples perform device discovery in the beginning in order to find indvidual bulbs, which causes a short but noticeable delay. To avoid device discovery, you can either instantiate Light objects directly using their MAC address and IP address (which you can learn by running `examples/hello_world.py`), or you can use the broadcast methods provided in the LifxLAN API. In the examples folder, `broadcast_on.py`, `broadcast_off.py`, and `broadcast_color.py` will allow you to send commands to all lights quickly from the command line without doing device discovery.

## Overview

You can do several things with this library:

* Control LIFX devices using the package's high-level API (see the `examples` folder and the following API sections).
* Build your own high-level API on top of the low-level networking messages.
* Build virtual LIFX devices in software (think adapters for Philips Hue bulbs, Wemo, etc).

#### High-Level API:

* **lifxlan.py** - Provides the LifxLAN API, and low-level API for sending broadcast LIFX packets to the LAN.
* **device.py** - Provides the Device API, and low-level API for sending unicast LIFX packets to a Device.
* **light.py** - Provides the Light API. Subclass of Device.
* **multizonelight.py** - Provides the MultiZoneLight API. Subclass of Light.

##### LifxLAN API

You can create a LifxLAN object to represent the local network:

```
lan = LifxLAN()
```

LifxLAN objects have the following methods:

```
# power can be "on"/"off", True/False, 0/1, or 0/65535
# color is a list of HSBK values: [hue (0-65535), saturation (0-65535), brightness (0-65535), Kelvin (2500-9000)]
# duration is the transition time in milliseconds
# rapid is True/False. If True, don't wait for successful confirmation, just send multiple packets and move on
# NOTE: rapid is meant for super-fast light shows with lots of changes. You should't need it for normal use.
# arguments in [square brackets] are optional

get_lights()                                                                                 # returns list of Light objects
set_power_all_lights(power, [duration], [rapid])                                             # set power for all lights on LAN
set_color_all_lights_color(color, [duration], [rapid])                                       # set color for all lights on LAN
set_waveform_all_lights(is_transient, color, period, cycles, duty_cycle, waveform, [rapid])  # see the Light API for more details
get_power_all_lights()                                                                       # returns dict of Light, power pairs
get_color_all_lights()                                                                       # returns dict of Light, color pairs
```

##### Device API

In keeping with the LIFX protocol, all lights are devices, and so support the following methods:

```
# label is a string, 32 char max
# power can be "on"/"off", True/False, 0/1, or 0/65535
# rapid is True/False. If True, don't wait for successful confirmation, just send multiple packets and move on
# NOTE: rapid is meant for super-fast light shows with lots of changes. You should't need it for normal use.
# arguments in [square brackets] are optional

set_label(label)            
set_power(power, [rapid])            
get_mac_addr()
get_ip_addr()
get_service()                       # returns int, 1 = UDP
get_port()                          
get_label()

get_host_firmware_build_timestamp()
get_host_firmware_version()

get_wifi_firmware_build_timestamp()
get_wifi_firmware_version()
get_version_tuple()                 # returns (vendor, product, version)
get_location()                      # Returns location id (bytearray length 16)
get_location_tuple()                # Returns a tuple of location(bytearray lenght 16), location_label(string), and location_updated_at(unsigned 64 bit epoch timestamp)
get_location_label()                # Returns location_label string
get_location_updated_at             # Returns location_updated_at unsigned 64 bit int -> epoch timestamp
get_group()                         # Returns group id (bytearray length 16)
get_group_tuple()                   # Returns a tuple of group(bytearray lenght 16), group_label(string), and group_updated_at(unsigned 64 bit epoch timestamp)
get_group_label()                   # Returns group_label(string)
get_group_updated_at                # Returns group_updated_at unsigned 64 bit int -> epoch timestamp
get_vendor()
get_product()
get_version()
get_info_tuple()                    # returns (time (current timestamp in ns), uptime (in ns), downtime (in ns, +/- 5 seconds))
get_time()
get_uptime()
get_downtime()
```

##### Light API

You can get Light objects automatically though LAN-based discovery (takes a few seconds), or by creating Light objects using a known MAC address and IP address:

```
lights = lan.get_lights()                              # Option 1a: Discovery
lights = lan.get_lights(4)                             # Option 1b: Discovery looking for a prespecified number of bulbs (faster than 1a)
light = Light("12:34:56:78:9a:bc", "192.168.1.42")     # Option 2: Direct
```

The Light API provides everything in the Device API, as well as:

```
# arguments in [square brackets] are optional
# power can be "on"/"off", True/False, 0/1, or 0/65535
# color is a HSBK list of values: [hue (0-65535), saturation (0-65535), brightness (0-65535), Kelvin (2500-9000)]
# duration is the transition time in milliseconds
# rapid is True/False. If True, don't wait for successful confirmation, just send multiple packets and move on
# is_transient is 1/0. If 1, return to the original color after the specified number of cycles. If 0, set light to specified color
# period is the length of one cycle in milliseconds
# cycles is the number of times to repeat the waveform
# duty_cycle is an integer between -32768 and 32767. Its effect is most obvious with the Pulse waveform
#     set duty_cycle to 0 to spend an equal amount of time on the original color and the new color
#     set duty_cycle to positive to spend more time on the original color
#     set duty_cycle to negative to spend more time on the new color
# waveform can be 0 = Saw, 1 = Sine, 2 = HalfSine, 3 = Triangle, 4 = Pulse (strobe)
# infrared_brightness (0-65535) - is the maximum infrared brightness when the lamp automatically turns on infrared (0 = off)

# NOTE: rapid is meant for super-fast light shows with lots of changes. You should't need it for normal use.
# NOTE: currently is_transient=1 results in bulbs staying on the last color of the waveform instead of original color.
# 99.9% sure that this is a LIFX problem and will likely fix itself with firmware updates when SetWaveform becomes an official part of the protocol.

set_power(power, [duration], [rapid])   
set_color(color, [duration], [rapid])                                   
set_waveform(is_transient, color, period, cycles, duty_cycle, waveform)     # currently experimental, undocumented in official protocol
get_power()                                                                 # returns 0 or 65535
get_color()                                                                 # returns color (HSBK list)
get_infrared()                                                              # returns infrared brightness (0 to 65535), or None if infrared is not supported
set_infrared(infrared_brightness)
```

The Light API also provides macros for basic colors, like RED, BLUE, GREEN, etc. Setting colors is as easy as `mybulb.set_color(BLUE)`. See light.py for complete list of color macros.

Finally, you can set parts of the color individually using the following four methods. However, the bulbs must receive all four values in each SetColor message. That means that using one of the following methods is always slower than using set_color(color) above because it will have to call get_color() first to get the other three values.

```
set_hue(hue, [duration], [rapid])                  # hue in range [0-65535]
set_brightness(brightness, [duration], [rapid])    # brightness in range [0-65535]
set_saturation(saturation, [duration], [rapid])    # saturation in range [0-65535]
set_colortemp(kelvin, [duration], [rapid])         # kelvin in range [2500-9000]
```

##### MultiZoneLight API

Lights with MultiZone capability, such as the LIFX Z, have all the same methods as the Light API, and also add the following:

```
# start and end refer to zone indices (inclusive).
# duration is the transition time in milliseconds
# rapid is True/False. True means there is no guarantee that the bulb will receive your message.
# apply is 1/0. If 0, queue up the change until a packet with apply=1 comes by, then apply all queued changes.

get_color_zones([start], [end])                                    # returns a list of [H,S,V,K] colors, one for each zone. Length of the list is the number of zones.
set_zone_color(start, end, color, [duration], [rapid], [apply])    # indices are inclusive and zero-indexed
set_zone_colors(colors, [duration], [rapid])                       # colors is a list of [H,S,V,K] colors, which will get applied to the zones in order. This makes it possible to restore the original colors easily after a display.
```

The LIFX Z can be instantiated as either a Light or MultiZoneLight object, but to use the MultiZone API you'll need to instantiate it as a MultiZoneLight. Just like with more generic Light objects, you can instantiate a MultiZoneLight directly with `light = MultiZoneLight("12:34:56:78:9a:bc", "192.168.1.42")`.

#### LIFX LAN Protocol Implementation:

The LIFX LAN protocol V2 specification is officially documented [here](https://github.com/LIFX/lifx-protocol-docs). In lifxlan, you can see the underlying stream of packets being sent and received at any time by initializing the LifxLAN object with the verbose flag set: `lifx = LifxLAN(verbose = True)`. (See `examples/verbose_lan.py`.) You can also set the verbose flag if creating a Light or MultiZoneLight object directly.

The files that deal with LIFX packet construction and representation are:

* **message.py** -  Defines the message fields and the basic packet structure.
* **msgtypes.py** - Provides subclasses for each LIFX message type, along with their payload constructors.
* **unpack.py** - Creates a LIFX message object from a string of binary data (crucial for receiving messages).

Happy hacking!
